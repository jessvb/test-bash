# test-bash
Repository for learning how to create and use bash scripts (e.g., a find-and-replace script).

## usage
To make a bash script executable, cd into the folder with the `.sh` script, and run:
```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

To run the script (now that it's executable), do the following:
```bash
sh script.sh
```
